# Ai-camera-m5-unit-v2-
I am doing a esp32 project about smart farm. I am using ai camera to get count of cattle. So how do I transfer my data from ai camera to esp32. I am using Thonny and adafruit as my iot dashboard. I am using a stream block which shows the date, time, and count of cattle. So how am I going to transfer data from ai camera to esp32 to adafruit?
